**Project Overview**

Our website will be an interactive platform designed to showcase player statistics from the NBA, NFL, and Premier League. The homepage will present dynamic "Trending Players" sections for each sport, allowing users to quickly see the top five performers based on recent data. From this main screen, users can seamlessly navigate to detailed player profiles and team informationâ€”including performance metrics, standings, and rosters. While our primary focus is on delivering clear, real-time trending data with intuitive navigation, we also plan to explore advanced enhancements such as normalized data analysis to identify statistical outliers (by computing z-scores for key metrics) and unique visualizations like performance trend lines, scatter plots, and interactive heat maps. These enhancements, time permitting, will offer deeper insights and set our platform apart from traditional sports statistics sites.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# How to run/build the website on VS Code:
- Download 'Node.js' and 'npm'
- Once the repository is cloned from github, type 'npm install' into the terminal
- Then type 'npm run dev' to build the tool, and a website link should come up.
